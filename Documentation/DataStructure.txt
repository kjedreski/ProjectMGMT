--We are using JSON as a data store, and the electron-storage app which uses the HTML 5 local storage feature --
-- data is stored   in C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\electron\storage
-- there is a function inside utils.js which reads the file path where your local date is.


Data structure is as follows for now:

{
    Timestamp: {
        "Comment<#>": {
            "comment": <some comment>,
            "time": <hours spent on comment
        }
    }
}


EXAMPLE:

{
    "7/1/2017": {
        "Comment1": {
            "comment": "Grid Research",
            "time": "4:44"
        },
          "Comment2": {
            "comment": "Emails",
            "time": "0:50"
        },
        
    }
        

}
